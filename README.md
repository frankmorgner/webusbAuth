[WebUSB] based Interface Device (IFD) handler for USB based Chip Card Interface Device(s) ([CCID]).

This is a proof-of-concept developed for my diploma thesis. I was supported by Humboldt-UniversitÃ¤t zu Berlin (Humboldt University of Berlin) and Bundesdruckerei GmbH ("Federal Printing Office"), especially by my two advisors.

### Run Demo ###
To run the demo, host a (simple) web server and access it with a WebUSB compatible Browser e.g. Chrome/Chromium >= 61.

```
                            +- Google Chrome ------------+      +--> WebSocketServer.py
                            |----------------------------|      |    (send GET CHALLENGE and
                            |                            |      |     output the cards result)
                            |     demo.html       +--WebSocket--+
                            |                     |      |      +--> WebSocketServerVICC.py
                            +---------------------|------+      |    (make card available via PC/SC
+-----+    +--------+       |                     v      |      |     on server in virtual reader)
|Smart|<-->|USB CCID| <--WebUSB--> ifd.js <--> ccid.js   |      |
|Card |    |Reader  |       |                            |      +--> WebSocketServerPACE.py
+-----+    +--------+       +----------------------------+           (Generate APDUs to
                                                                      Establish a PACE channel)
```

#### Web Server ####
A simple, Python3.6 based web server, `HttpServer.py`, is included. For remote APDU forwarding a WebSocket server example, `WebSocketServer.py` is included. `WebSocketServerPACE` implements PACE protocol with german id token (nPA).

SSL/TLS encryption is left off for debugging. To enable it see comments in `HttpServer.py` or `WebSocket*.py`.

#### OS specific requirements ####
Making a CCID available to WebUSB, unless they come with a WebUSB compatible driver or device, requires operating system specific actions.
- For Windows [Zadig](http://zadig.akeo.ie/) is recommended to load the generic WinUSB driver for your CCID.
- For Linux, the user's browser needs write access to the usb device. This can be done by creating a custom udev rule. See the following example rule created in `/etc/udev/rules.d/50-Identiv-4700F.rules` and adding your user to the `plugdev` group in `etc/group`.
```
SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="04e6", ATTR{idProduct}=="5720", MODE="0600", GROUP="plugdev"
```
Vendor Id and Product Id of your CCID can be identified using `lsusb` command.

### Usage in standalone applications based on electron ###
[electron] provides a Chromium based framework to build native applications for Linux, Mac and Windows. If Chromium >= 61 is used, it supports WebUSB. At time of testing, this was only the case with the beta version.

A working starting point can be the [quick-start example] installed using `npm install -D electron@beta`. Once started (`npm start`), `navigator.usb` is available in the included developer console (Ctrl+Shift+I).
